**My Portfolio Website** 🚀

**Hey there!** 👋

Welcome to the GitHub repo for my personal portfolio website. It's **not 100% ready** yet (is anything ever?), but I wanted to get it out there instead of holding on to it forever while I tweak every little thing! 😅

 **What’s Here?** 💻

This is where I showcase my work, skills, and the journey I'm on as an **intermediate frontend developer**. I'll be adding new projects and features as I continue learning and exploring new things.

 **Why Is It Live If It’s Not Finished?** 🤔

I’ve learned that perfecting something can slow me down in my learning process. So, rather than wait for it to be "just right," I’m pushing this out into the world as I keep improving it. You’ll probably see changes happening over time — new designs, smoother code, and better UX/UI as I grow.

 **What’s Next?** 🔧

- **Fixing bugs** I haven’t caught yet 👀
- **Updating layouts** for responsiveness
- **Adding new projects** as I build them
- Maybe a **blog section** to document my journey?

 **Wanna Follow Along?** 🛠️

Feel free to fork the project, create an issue, or suggest improvements! This is a learning space for me, but I’m always open to new ideas.

Thanks for checking it out! 😊
